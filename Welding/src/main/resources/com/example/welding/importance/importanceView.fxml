Here’s a detailed explanation:&#10;&#10;1. Corrosion resistance:&#10;The marine environment contains saltwater, which causes rapid rusting and corrosion in metals like &#10;steel. Aluminium 5083 naturally forms a protective oxide layer on its surface, preventing corrosion &#10;even in salty and humid conditions. This makes it suitable for the hull and deck areas, which are &#10;constantly exposed to seawater and air.&#10;&#10;2. Lightweight:&#10;Aluminium 5083 is much lighter which improves fuel efficiency, speed, and load capacity.&#10;&#10;3. Strength and toughness:&#10;Despite being light, Al 5083 has good mechanical strength and can withstand the stresses and &#10;vibrations experienced by ships during operation.&#10;&#10;4.Low maintenance:&#10;Since it does not rust like steel, it requires less painting and upkeep, lowering maintenance costs.&#10;&#10;5. Strength retention after welding:&#10;Welds in Aluminium 5083 typically retain 60–80% of the base metal’s strength, which is &#10;significantly better than heat-treatable aluminium alloys (such as 6061).">
